# stream-analyzer
A tool that sees how fast you can stream in osu.

Currently WIP, supports only left and right click now. The "select your buttons" does nothing.

To do:
- fix button selection (users should only be able to use two buttons)
- Add UR
- Add accuracy based on OD and custom BPM
- Add blue, green, orange timing thing at the bottom of osu
- Add cool graph thing
